*exam mode in previous terms (based on student reports)*

- vowi: 
	- Exam: About 4-5 open questions, to be answered in 1-2 sentences or with a mathematical formula. Those aim mostly at understanding, i.e. they ask about some of the concepts covered (e.g. similarity between items, ...) but give different examples for applying them. Additionally, for about 2-3 different topics, about 2-5 True/False statementes each.
	- The exam is open book, i.e. all material from the lecture and self-prepared material can be used. The material was not checked. Even computers where allowed "as long as they were used for checking the slides".
	- The exam lasts for 1 hour physical retake exam of SS 2020, which is not a lot but still OK. There was also a TUWEL-based exam as the main exam of SS 2020, due to Covid-19 situation.
	- For the exam, it may help to summarize the most important stuff and bring some notes and the slides to the exam. Also, try to critically think about the concepts and try to ask different questions about the statements given in the slides, as the exam aks more for understanding of the concepts with examples a little different that what is covered in slides and exercises (but in a constructive way imho).
- discord:
	- TISS says online open book exam with open and true/false questions
	- not open book anymore
	- Multiple Choice (TUWEL offline test / 75% of the total points) Open Questions (25% of the total points)
- mattermost:
	- The exam last year was open book and really nicely graded. If you didn't exactly follow the intended idea but used your own ideas you got full points

*exam mode 2024SS (student report)*

- exam questions were pretty much just like previous years but on paper in a closed book format.
- questions were pretty much the same.
- grades got scaled in the end because a couple of questions were out of scope.
- you had to memorize the F1 formula and a couple of other things but since the questions were so similar to the previous ones it was super easy nonetheless.
