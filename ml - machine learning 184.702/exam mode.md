*exam mode in previous terms (based on students)*

- vowi:
	- At least last two exams (WS2022) were entirely MC tests, no open questions. However, they contained a few calculations you had to perform but they gave you 6 options to choose from. Overall, the exam was surprisingly easy, and it contained a few of the older questions (especially in the true/false part).
- discord: 
	- 2023: There are 12 T/F questions (+1 correct, -0.5 wrong answer) And some open answer questions, supposedly one with a simple algorithm to go through. 90 minutes
	- 2024: multiple choice questions without open questions
- mattermost:
	- covid exam: 15 MC questions (t/f, negative points for wrong answers), 6 open questions, no additional tools like calculators required
	- 2023: Only multiple choice questions, the first 16 or so were relatively easy true/false questsions, then there were 4 examples where calculations were in order (computing where epsilon move happened in reinforcement learning episode, computing on which attribute the deciscion tree will split, computing naive bayes, and computing RMSE for a regression task), then there were 8 or so questions where potentially multiple answers were correct, and these were the a bit more difficult ones.
