*exam mode 2024SS (based on students)*

- these are some of the questions from the exam in January
- pt1: True or False single choice questions (mostly already available in older exams) +2 points for correct answer, 0 points for no answer, -1 point for incorrect answer
- pt2: Very simple calculations (no calculator needed) for topics such as k armed bandits, root means squared error, 1R feature selection and convolution with stride 2: +3 points for correct answer, 0 points for no answer, -1.5 points for incorrect answer
- pt3: multiple choice questions on topics like feature selection, image augmentation or preprocessing. one question was what to do with missing values in test and training set. ? points for correct answer, 0 points for incorrect OR incomplete answer

*exam mode in previous terms (based on students)*

- vowi:
	- At least last two exams (WS2022) were entirely MC tests, no open questions. However, they contained a few calculations you had to perform but they gave you 6 options to choose from. Overall, the exam was surprisingly easy, and it contained a few of the older questions (especially in the true/false part).
- discord: 
	- 2023: There are 12 T/F questions (+1 correct, -0.5 wrong answer) And some open answer questions, supposedly one with a simple algorithm to go through. 90 minutes
	- 2024: multiple choice questions without open questions
- mattermost:
	- covid exam: 15 MC questions (t/f, negative points for wrong answers), 6 open questions, no additional tools like calculators required
	- 2023: Only multiple choice questions, the first 16 or so were relatively easy true/false questsions, then there were 4 examples where calculations were in order (computing where epsilon move happened in reinforcement learning episode, computing on which attribute the deciscion tree will split, computing naive bayes, and computing RMSE for a regression task), then there were 8 or so questions where potentially multiple answers were correct, and these were the a bit more difficult ones.
