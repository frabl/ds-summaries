# chapter 1

**question**: which of the following statements about attention in visual processing are true?

- a) attention is important in determining what information is retained from visual input.
- b) attention in contextualized representations allows models to dynamically focus on relevant parts of input, unlike humans who can focus on multiple things simultaneously without any selectivity.
- c) visual queries, which are acts of attention driving eye movements, are important to consider in visualization design.
- d) inattentional blindness demonstrates that visual changes can NEVER go unnoticed, even if humans don't concentrate at all.

answer:

- a) true
	- attention drives what information we retain from visual input
- b) false
	- the first part of the question is (true but) unrelated to information visualization
	- the second part of the question is false, because attention is all about selective perception since humans can't focus on too many things at once
- c) true
	- visual queries are described as "acts of attention driving our eye-movements"
- d) false
	- inattentional blindness actually demonstrates the opposite - that without attention, even significant visual changes can go unnoticed
