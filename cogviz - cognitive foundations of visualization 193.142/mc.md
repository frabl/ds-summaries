**question**: which of the following statements about attention in visual processing are true?

- a) attention is important in determining what information is retained from visual input.
- b) attention in contextualized representations allows models to dynamically focus on relevant parts of input, unlike humans who can focus on multiple things simultaneously without any selectivity.
- c) visual queries, which are acts of attention driving eye movements, are important to consider in visualization design.
- d) inattentional blindness demonstrates that visual changes can NEVER go unnoticed, even if humans don't concentrate at all.

answer:

- a) true
	- attention drives what information we retain from visual input
- b) false
	- the first part of the question is (true but) unrelated to information visualization
	- the second part of the question is false, because attention is all about selective perception since humans can't focus on too many things at once
- c) true
	- visual queries are described as "acts of attention driving our eye-movements"
- d) false
	- inattentional blindness actually demonstrates the opposite - that without attention, even significant visual changes can go unnoticed

**question**: which of the following statements best describes the concept of visual channel expressiveness in data visualization?

- a) how well a human can carry out a task with a given visual representation
- b) the number of data points that can be displayed using a particular visual channel
- c) the potential for channel mismatch when encoding data inappropriately
- d) the type of information that can or cannot be expressed with a channel

answer: 

- a) false
	- this is describing effectiveness, not expressiveness.
	- effectiveness = how well a channel can express information.
	- expressiveness = which types of information can be expressed by a channel (ie. quantitative, sequential, categorical data)
- b) false
	- this is describing capacity or scalability, not expressiveness.
- c) true
	- a channel mismatch happens when data is encoded using the wrong channel, leading to misinterpretation / unintended implications
- d) true
	- based definition from lecture: "Expressiveness is about the type of information that can or can't be expressed by a channel."

**question**: which of the following statements is true about how visual stimuli are processed by humans?

- a) the fovea provides high-resolution vision in a small area, about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length.
- b) visual processing occurs in stages, with early stages detecting low-level features like color and orientation in parallel and later stages.
- c) saccadic eye movements allow us to rapidly sample information from different parts of a scene that get stitched together in our cognitive system.
- d) attention plays a very important role in determining what visual information is retained and processed further.

answer:

- a) true - the fovea is a small region of the retina with the highest density of cone cells, providing sharp central vision
- b) true - the visual system processes information hierarchically, from simple features to more complex representations
- c) true - saccades help us quickly scan a scene, with the brain integrating information from multiple fixations
- d) true - attention acts as a filter to select the most relevant information for further processing.

**question**: when evaluating visualization designs, which of the following approaches are recommended?

- a) explicitly identify the tasks the visualization is meant to help accomplish
- b) consider the visual queries needed to answer specific questions
- c) compare how easily different designs and visual channels support relevant visual queries
- d) focus solely on the aesthetic appeal of the visualization

answer:

- a, b, c) true
	- the evaluation of visualizations is essentially an information retrieval task
	- the first step in evaluating visual designs is making tasks and the corresponding visual queries explicit, then considering the visual queries needed to answer specific questions and finally comparing how easily different designs support retrieving information for the given queries
- d) false
	- aesthetic appeal is subjective and not a universal way to evaluate visualizations
	- although research has shown that aesthetics can influence the perceived usability of data visualizations (see: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4261021_The_Effect_of_Aesthetic_on_the_Usability_of_Data_Visualization)

**question**: why might inattentional blindness be particularly problematic for data visualization?

- a) it prevents users from seeing preattentive features
- b) it can cause users to miss important changes or patterns in the data
- c) it reduces the effectiveness of color as a visual channel
- d) it limits the number of visual queries a user can perform

answer:

 - a) false
	 - preattentive feature perception isn't affected.
- b) true
	- users might miss important information if their attention is focused elsewhere.
	- the attention of the observers must be guided to the most important graphical or symbolic elements.
- c) false
	- color perception isn't affected.
- d) mostly false
	- it doesn't directly limit the number of visual queries, but may affect their effectiveness.

**question**: which of the following is not a valid reason for why humans perceive they have full awareness of their visual field despite only seeing a small portion in high resolution?

- a) saccadic eye movements
- b) attention-driven perception
- c) the world acting as its own memory
- d) the fovea expanding under cognitive load

answer:

- a) true - saccadic movements allow rapid sampling of the visual field
- b) true - attention helps focus on relevant information
- c) true - the world acts as an external memory store
- d) false - the fovea does not expand under cognitive load

**question**:  which of the following is NOT a characteristic of low-level vision processing in areas v1 and v2 of the brain?

- a) parallel processing
- b) detection of complex semantic meanings
- c) tuning to specific visual properties
- d) rapid, unconscious processing

answer:

- a) false - characteristic of v1 and v2 processing.
- b) true - complex semantic processing occurs in higher-level brain areas, not v1 and v2.
- c) false - characteristic of v1 and v2 processing (they're called tunable properties)
- d) false - characteristic of v1 and v2 processing.

**question**: which of the following would be the MOST effective way to represent a 7-point likert scale (hint: ordinal data) in a visualization?

- a) 7 different shapes
- b) a continuous color gradient
- c) 7 distinct positions on an axis
- d) 7 different textures

answer:

- a) false - shapes are categorical but not inherently ordered.
- b) false - a continuous gradient isn't suitable for discrete data.
- c) true - position is highly effective for ordered and discrete data.
- d) false - textures can show order but are less effective than position.
