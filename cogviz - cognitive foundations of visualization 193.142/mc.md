**question**: which of the following statements about attention in visual processing are true?

- a) attention is important in determining what information is retained from visual input.
- b) attention in contextualized representations allows models to dynamically focus on relevant parts of input, unlike humans who can focus on multiple things simultaneously without any selectivity.
- c) visual queries, which are acts of attention driving eye movements, are important to consider in visualization design.
- d) inattentional blindness demonstrates that visual changes can NEVER go unnoticed, even if humans don't concentrate at all.

answer:

- a) true
	- attention drives what information we retain from visual input
- b) false
	- the first part of the question is (true but) unrelated to information visualization
	- the second part of the question is false, because attention is all about selective perception since humans can't focus on too many things at once
- c) true
	- visual queries are described as "acts of attention driving our eye-movements"
- d) false
	- inattentional blindness actually demonstrates the opposite - that without attention, even significant visual changes can go unnoticed

**question**: which of the following statements best describes the concept of visual channel expressiveness in data visualization?

- a) how well a human can carry out a task with a given visual representation
- b) the number of data points that can be displayed using a particular visual channel
- c) the potential for channel mismatch when encoding data inappropriately
- d) the type of information that can or cannot be expressed with a channel

answer: 

- a) false
	- this is describing effectiveness, not expressiveness.
	- effectiveness = how well a channel can express information.
	- expressiveness = which types of information can be expressed by a channel (ie. quantitative, sequential, categorical data)
- b) false
	- this is describing capacity or scalability, not expressiveness.
- c) true
	- a channel mismatch happens when data is encoded using the wrong channel, leading to misinterpretation / unintended implications
- d) true
	- based definition from lecture: "Expressiveness is about the type of information that can or can't be expressed by a channel."
