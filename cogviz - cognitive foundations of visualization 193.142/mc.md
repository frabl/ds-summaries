**question**: which of the following statements about attention in visual processing are true?

- a) attention is important in determining what information is retained from visual input.
- b) attention in contextualized representations allows models to dynamically focus on relevant parts of input, unlike humans who can focus on multiple things simultaneously without any selectivity.
- c) visual queries, which are acts of attention driving eye movements, are important to consider in visualization design.
- d) inattentional blindness demonstrates that visual changes can NEVER go unnoticed, even if humans don't concentrate at all.

answer:

- a) true
	- attention drives what information we retain from visual input
- b) false
	- the first part of the question is (true but) unrelated to information visualization
	- the second part of the question is false, because attention is all about selective perception since humans can't focus on too many things at once
- c) true
	- visual queries are described as "acts of attention driving our eye-movements"
- d) false
	- inattentional blindness actually demonstrates the opposite - that without attention, even significant visual changes can go unnoticed

**question**: which of the following statements best describes the concept of visual channel expressiveness in data visualization?

- a) how well a human can carry out a task with a given visual representation
- b) the number of data points that can be displayed using a particular visual channel
- c) the potential for channel mismatch when encoding data inappropriately
- d) the type of information that can or cannot be expressed with a channel

answer: 

- a) false
	- this is describing effectiveness, not expressiveness.
	- effectiveness = how well a channel can express information.
	- expressiveness = which types of information can be expressed by a channel (ie. quantitative, sequential, categorical data)
- b) false
	- this is describing capacity or scalability, not expressiveness.
- c) true
	- a channel mismatch happens when data is encoded using the wrong channel, leading to misinterpretation / unintended implications
- d) true
	- based definition from lecture: "Expressiveness is about the type of information that can or can't be expressed by a channel."

**question**: which of the following statements is true about how visual stimuli are processed by humans?

- a) the fovea provides high-resolution vision in a small area, about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length.
- b) visual processing occurs in stages, with early stages detecting low-level features like color and orientation in parallel and later stages.
- c) saccadic eye movements allow us to rapidly sample information from different parts of a scene that get stitched together in our cognitive system.
- d) attention plays a very important role in determining what visual information is retained and processed further.

answer:

- a) true
	- the fovea is a small region of the retina with the highest density of cone cells, providing sharp central vision
- b) true
	- the visual system processes information hierarchically, from simple features to more complex representations
- c) true
	- saccades help us quickly scan a scene, with the brain integrating information from multiple fixations
- d) true
	- attention acts as a filter to select the most relevant information for further processing.
