> this is just a report from a recent discussion a student had with prof. huemer. do your own research.

_general info:_

- the tu and the company sign a cooperation contract.
- the student is not allowed to have any other contract of employment with the tu (except most likely being tutor for a course).
- the recommended fee for the contract between tu and company is eur 5000, but this is negotiable.

- generally there is no time limit when and how the master thesis should be completed (as one might get from them not specifying).
- at the end, your supervisor decides what conditions the tu sets for the cooperation and whether the research aspect is fulfilled or not.
- prof. huemer does not recommend writing a thesis in cooperation with a company (as expected).

- there is no "one" cooperation contract, this varies for every supervisor and is intended that way.
- they are trying to improve the system when it comes to offering thesis topics internally, but this will take time. the idea is that potential supervisors should answer mails faster and maybe there will be something of a short topic representation per research group at the beginning of the semester like we know of from other faculties.
- prof. huemer suggests meeting potential supervisors in person when they do not answer per mail (which can be hard as some only offer office ours with agreement on mail beforehand).

_the step by step approach is the following:_

1. find a company you want to work with and get their project idea
2. convince a supervisor at tu that this project is amazing
3. let the tu supervisor and the company figure out the legal stuff
4. write a proposal and present it
5. see whether they reject your proposal (that was news to me, that this is actually possible, i thought it was just a critique so you could improve it)
6. if rejected start at 1 again or give up and do some work with the university
7. continue like descripted at  https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/study-services/master-graduation/
