# comparing modules

_fds: fundamentals of data science_

> conclusion: avoid this. the "data stewardship" course is too boring and useless for how much effort it is.

- fds/core
	- data acquisition and survey methods
		- ✓ project based
		- ✓ fully remote
		- ✓ easy exercises
			- 7 datacamp R courses about web scraping, data wrangling, data visualization
			- 1 solo assignment where you scrape weather data
			- 1 group assignment where you have to gather data from other students through surveys and present your findings
	- data stewardship
		- ✓ vo course (with exams during holidays)
		- 𝙓 lectures aren’t recorded, the slides aren’t self-explanatory
		- 𝙓 written exam (might be oral if there are fewer participants), closed book, many abbreviations to memorize
		- 𝙓 very boring: the management and legal aspects of data in large companies
- fds/extension
	- +5 project based courses
	- 0 vo courses
	- very few courses to pick from

_mls: machine learning and statistics_

> conclusion: the most interesting module. highly recommended.

- mls/core
	- recommender systems
		- ✓ open book exam, aimed at understanding
		- ✓ fully remote
		- 4 python assignments and a group project
	- statistical simulation and computer intensive methods
		- ✓ project based
		- ✓ fully remote, lectures are recorded
		- ✓ easy exercises, 9 exercises in R
		- 𝙓 slides and exercises are messy: you’ll need to spend some time relearning statistics basics
- mls/extension
	- +5 project based courses
	- 4 vo based courses
	- most courses to pick from, compared to all modules

_bdhpc: big data and high-performance computing_

> conclusion: too much effort if you haven't done parcomp

- bdhpc/core
	- basics of parallel computing
		- ✓ open book exam
		- ✓ identical to parcomp from cs bachelors, but with 10% less material
	- efficient programs
		- ✓ project based
		- ✓ fully remote
		- assumes c/c++ knowledge, you’ll have to optimize a given program and present it
- bdhpc/extension
	- +8 project based courses
	- 2 vo based courses
	- access to cloud and gpu courses

_vast: visual analytics and semantic technologies_

> conclusion: the easiest module. highly recommended.

- vast/core
	- advanced information retrieval
		- ✓ open book exam, aimed at understanding
		- ✓ no real prerequisites
		- ✓ fully remote, got "best distance learning" award
	- design and evaluation of visualisations
		- ✓ project based
		- ✓ easy exercises about hci
		- 𝙓 requires class participation for quizzes and discussing papers
- vast/extension
	- +7 project based courses
	- 3 vo based courses
